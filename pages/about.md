Hallo! ðŸ‘‹<br/><br/>
These are my notes &mdash; a neatly <strike>un-</strike>organized collection of my thoughts and ideas.<br/>
Here you can find everything from new-norwegian literature notes to opinionated best practices for writing bash scripts and managing a docker environment.<br/>
You can find my notes <a href="../notes" style="color:var(--link);">here</a>, or perhaps filter by <a href="../tags" style="color:var(--link);">tags</a>.<br/>
